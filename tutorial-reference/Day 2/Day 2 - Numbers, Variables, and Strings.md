# Day 2 - Numbers, Variables, and Strings
This is meant as a reference to the concepts of Numbers, Variables, and Strings in Python.

### Numbers / Integers 

Adding
```
10 + 10
```
Multiply
```
9 * 32
```
Divide

24 / 6

Exponent 

4 ** 2

Modulo (Remainder)

24 % 5

Greater Than

55 > 22

Less Than

132 < 123


Syntax Errors
```
>>> Hello World
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```


### Strings
Strings are basically a set of ordered characters. For example, someones name.

To print in python, use print("the thing you want to print") 

print("James")
>>James

A better way to use strings is by using f strings:

name = "James" 
age = '20'

f"My name is {name} and I am {age}."
>>'My name is James and I am 20.'
