# Day 1 - Install Python

For the vast majority of beginners, you can just do a default install of Python 3.8 from [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)

Once you have it downloaded, you can open a program called `Idle` in the Python 3.8 folder (aka directory). 
After installing python you have to install the editor like Atom, Pycharm etc. then you will be able to run the python program.
